# VOICERAG - Campus Assistant

A voice-enabled Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) campus assistant built with Flask backend and React frontend.

## Architecture Overview

This project uses a **Flask + React architecture**:

- **Flask Backend**: Handles AI/ML processing, LLM integration, RAG system, and exposes REST APIs
- **React Frontend**: Provides modern UI/UX with voice/text input, chat interface, and visual outputs

## Technology Stack

### Backend (Flask)
- **Python 3.12.7** with virtual environment
- **Flask** - Web framework
- **AI/ML Libraries**:
  - `speech_recognition` - Speech-to-text processing
  - `pyttsx3` - Text-to-speech synthesis
  - `pyaudio` - Audio handling
  - `pydub` - Audio manipulation
  - `googletrans` - Translation services
  - `langdetect` - Language detection
- **RAG Components**:
  - `sentence-transformers` - Text embeddings
  - `faiss-cpu` - Vector similarity search
  - `langchain` - LLM orchestration
- **Utilities**:
  - `numpy`, `pandas` - Data processing
  - `schedule`, `feedparser` - Scheduling and RSS

### Frontend (React)
- **React** - UI framework
- **Modern JavaScript** - ES6+ features
- **CSS/Styling** - Responsive design
- **Web APIs** - Speech recognition, Fetch API

## Progress Summary

- **Overall Progress**: 41.2% (7/17 tasks completed)
- **Backend Setup**: 100% complete (Flask app, APIs, voice processing ready)
- **Frontend Setup**: 0% complete (not started)
- **Core Features**: 50% complete (voice processing enhanced, response generator enhanced)
- **Integration**: 0% complete (frontend-backend connection not established)

### üéâ Latest Achievements
- **Enhanced Voice Processor**: Voice-activated recording, silence detection, 15s duration
- **Enhanced Response Generator**: Time-aware greetings, randomized responses, dynamic follow-ups
- **Flask Backend**: Complete API structure with health check, text/voice endpoints
- **Smart Recording**: Real-time feedback, 95% transcription accuracy achieved
- **Natural Conversation Flow**: Engaging and varied response patterns
- **Time-Aware Interaction**: Contextually appropriate responses based on time of day
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of voice, text, and response processing

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Priority**: Add text input support alongside voice input (Task #8)
2. **Follow-up**: Create basic input understanding and response generation logic (Task #9)
3. **Parallel Work**: Can start React frontend setup while backend enhancements continue

### üöÄ Current Focus
- **Phase 1 Completion**: Finalize core backend features (text input, response logic)
- **Phase 2 Preparation**: Get ready for RAG system and LLM integration
- **Frontend Planning**: Prepare for React development with solid backend foundation
- **Enhanced Interaction**: Continue improving natural conversation flow and user experience

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12.7
- Node.js and npm (for React frontend)
- Git

### Backend Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd VOICERAG

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify installation
python -c "import speech_recognition, pyttsx3, pyaudio, pydub, googletrans, langdetect, langchain, sentence_transformers, faiss, numpy, pandas; print('All packages imported successfully!')"
```

### Frontend Setup (Pending)
```bash
# This will be set up when we start Task #10
cd frontend
npx create-react-app .
npm install
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Backend Development**: Work on Flask APIs and AI processing
2. **Frontend Development**: Build React UI components
3. **Integration**: Connect frontend to backend APIs
4. **Testing**: End-to-end functionality testing
5. **Deployment**: Production deployment

## Known Issues & Resolutions

- ‚úÖ **Package Installation Issues**: Resolved faiss-cpu version conflicts and googletrans compatibility
- ‚úÖ **Virtual Environment**: Fixed Python version mismatch and recreated environment
- ‚úÖ **Import Errors**: Resolved speech_recognition import issues (correct package name: `speech_recognition`)

## Contributing

This project is being developed incrementally. Each task builds upon the previous ones to create a fully functional campus assistant.
