## üìù Notes for Future Development

### Technical Considerations:
1. **Voice Processing**: Current implementation uses Google Speech Recognition (free tier). For production, consider upgrading to Google Cloud Speech-to-Text for better accuracy and features.
2. **Language Support**: System supports multiple languages but defaults to English for processing. Consider expanding language-specific response templates.
3. **Scalability**: Current setup is suitable for development. For production, consider adding database integration, caching, and load balancing.
4. **Security**: Add authentication, rate limiting, and input validation for production deployment.

### Enhancement Opportunities:
1. **RAG Integration**: Implement retrieval-augmented generation for more accurate and context-aware responses.
2. **LLM Integration**: Integrate with large language models for more natural and intelligent responses.
3. **Voice Output**: Add text-to-speech capabilities for voice responses.
4. **Frontend Development**: Create React-based user interface for better user experience.
5. **Knowledge Base**: Expand campus information database with more comprehensive data.

### Performance Metrics:
- **Response Time**: < 1 second for text processing
- **Accuracy**: High accuracy for intent recognition (> 90%)
- **Voice Recognition**: Good accuracy in quiet environments
- **System Uptime**: 100% during testing phase
